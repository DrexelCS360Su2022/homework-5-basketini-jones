Please let us know how much time you spent on each problem. You may enter time using any format described [here](https://github.com/wroberts/pytimeparse). Please put your time estimates *on the same line* as the problem label, not on the following line.

Problem 1:  1 hour 5 minutes

The main difficulty in this problem was just getting used to Haskell syntax. The actual logic for the problem was pretty easy.

Problem 2: 55 minutes

This one also wasn't too bad. My biggest difficulty was figuring out how to put d into the pow function, since it had the extra i argument that g and h didn't have.

Problem 3:  1 hour 30 minutes

This one was a pain just because the actual logic and recursive algorithm was very tough to wrap my head around. It helped that Set had plenty of useful helper functions included with it.
